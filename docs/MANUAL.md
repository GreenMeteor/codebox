# Module Installation

1. Download via Git or download button option
2. Upload the contents of the zip file to your HumHub instance's `*/protected/modules` directory
3. Navigate to your ***Modules List*** where it lists all your available modules and look for **Codebox** and click enable.

> Note: Green Meteor will not provide any support for personal widgets that you yourself have created, be sure that any script based code supports PJax fully before using or else unknown issues could happen.
